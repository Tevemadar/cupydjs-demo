# CupydJS-demo
Proof-of-concept 3D slicer for tiled ("cubed") multiscale volume pyramids.

This is a [working example](https://tevemadar.github.io/cupydjs-demo/), under construction. Things can be dragged around (requires mouse for now) and modalities can be switched.

Data comes from Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain ([NITRC](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/whs-sd-atlas)).

* MRI - T2* volume converted to 8-bit grayscale
* DTI - Color FA volume, 24-bit color

(Quality is low, quality of JPEG compression has been set to 80% in order to reduce overall amount of data)
